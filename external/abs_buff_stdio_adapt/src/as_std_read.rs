/// An adapter that exposes a [`TrBuffTryRead`] buffer as a non-blocking

///
/// Each `read` call drains as much data as the source currently offers: the
/// borrowed segment's buffer *is* the source's own memory, and the data is
/// moved straight into the caller's `buf` through the segment's move
/// primitive (`SegmRef::move_items_to_buff`), which advances the segment's
/// offset — so the source commits exactly the moved amount when the segment
/// drops (the `abs_buff` per-piece reclaim granularity). Nothing is copied
/// through an intermediate buffer.
///
/// The loop stops when `buf` is full, the source is drained (EOF), or the
/// cancellation token is signalled. Following the std convention, an error
/// reported by `try_read` (e.g. the source being temporarily empty) is
/// deferred: if anything was already read it is returned first, and the error
/// is only surfaced by the call that makes no progress.
