/// An adapter that exposes a [`TrBuffTryWrite`] buffer as a non-blocking
/// `std::io::Write`.
///
/// Each `write` call pushes as many bytes as the sink currently accepts: the
/// borrowed segment's buffer *is* the sink's own memory, and the source bytes
/// are cloned straight into it through the segment's `clone_items_from_buff`
/// primitive, which advances the segment's offset — so the sink commits
/// exactly the written amount when the segment drops (the `abs_buff`
/// per-piece reclaim granularity). Nothing is copied through an intermediate
/// buffer.
///
/// The loop stops when `buf` is exhausted, the sink is blocked, or the
/// cancellation token is signalled. Following the std convention, an error
/// reported by `try_write` (e.g. the sink being stuffed) is deferred: if
/// anything was already written it is returned first, and the error is only
/// surfaced by the call that makes no progress.
